# Before the Sale: Expenses to Expect #
Here are the typical upfront expenses. Some are a matter of choice, yet may be important investments in making sure your house sells for the highest amount possible -- or sells at all. 

## Painting ##
A new paint job is one of most cost-effective ways of freshening your house up, inside and out. If you've recently painted, this is less important -- though if your color choices were bold or unique, you might want to tone them down with some crowd-pleasing neutrals. [Here are some do's and don'ts from HGTV](http://www.hgtv.com/design/decorating/design-101/painting-dos-and-donts)

## Window washing ##
When did you last wash them -- especially on the outside panes of upper floors? Sparkling windows make a surprisingly large difference to buyer perceptions. Hiring someone will cost a few hundred dollars, depending on the size and height of your home.

## Repairs ##
Which repairs are necessary (such as replacing cracked windows or stained carpeting) and which (such as major remodels) should be left for the buyer to handle is a separate discussion in itself. But there's practically no house that couldn't use some quick maintenance to make sure it looks well-cared for and leaves fewer items for a home inspector to comment on.

## Staging ##
Staging your home, or having a decorator help declutter, reorganize, and in some cases refurnish it after you've moved your stuff out, can help impress buyers in a big way. In fact, studies show that buyers pay more for staged homes. Expect to pay a professional stager a few thousand dollars for their services (a bit less if some of your own furniture is usable.)

## Additional Decor Items ##
Even if you decide to save money by staging your own home, you're almost guaranteed to have to buy things like a new doormat, new plush towels for the bathroom, flowers for the showings, and more depending on what your house needs. Other likely possibilities include new couch cushions, area rugs, a nice table runner, and artwork to replace your wall of kids' photos.

## Landscaping ##
Buyers are increasingly interested in the state of your garden. If it's already fully planted, you'll want to hire someone (or put in some sweat equity) to get it raked, pruned, and otherwise tidied up. If the area hasn't already been landscaped, plan to add some new greenery and flowering plants.

## Pre-inspection reports ##
Having a professional inspect your house for either termite/pest damage or other structural matters isn't required, nor expected in most parts of the United States. Buyers expect to pay for their own inspectors, and in fact will probably want to hire ones they know and trust regardless of whether you've had the property inspected first. Yet there are situations where you might want to have the house inspected before letting buyers in -- for example, if you've owned the property for many years and wonder whether any problems have arisen "below the hood" that you're oblivious to, and would perhaps prefer to fix before buyers have a chance to get upset about them. Inspections will run you upwards of $200.

# At Closing: More Expenses to Expect #
The good news is most of what you'll be paying out at closing will come out of the sale proceeds. The bad news is you'll be saying goodbye to some big dollars.

## Agent commissions ##
You, as the seller, will likely be paying the entire 5% - 7% commission, to be split between the buyer's agent and yours.  On a $150,000 house, that comes to around $10,000

## Home Warranties ##
Whether because the buyer requests it or to make the buyer feel secure about the home purchase, many sellers buy a home warranty on the buyer's behalf. This is a service contract that covers repairs to appliances and certain systems within the house for the first year of ownership. It will cost about $500.

## Seller Concessions ##
You might have agreed -- based on local tradition or buyer negotiation -- to pay various of the standard costs associated with closing the deal. With the market down, some buyers are asking sellers to pay all of the closing costs, which typically add up to 2% to 4% of the selling price.

## Transfer tax ##
Your city or state may require you to pay transfer taxes, as a small percentage of the sale price.

## Title Insurance ##
In most cases, the seller is required to furnish title insurance to the buyer. This insurance serves as a guarantee to the buyer that the title is clear and that there are no unpaid loans, liens, finance charges, judgments or title defects at the time of the sale. Depending upon the price of the house and where you live, this typically costs between $400 and $1500.

## Closing Fees ##
The attorney who performs the closing will charge a fee for their services. They are responsible for handling the necessary paperwork, making sure it is properly signed and notarized and dispersing all of the funds to the proper recipients. For these services, they will normally charge between $200 and $800.
